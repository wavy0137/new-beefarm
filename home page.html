        <h1>Why farm with bees</h1>
        <h4>🐝 1. Pollination</h4>
Bees are natural pollinators.

They help crops like fruits, vegetables, nuts,<br> and seeds reproduce by transferring pollen from flower to <br>flower.

Up to 70% of the world’s <br>crops depend on bee pollination.

Without bees, yields drop, and food prices rise.<br>

Example: Apples, carrots, pumpkins, avocados,<br> and almonds rely heavily on bee pollination.

<h4>🍯 2. Honey Production</h4>
Bees produce honey, a natural, long-lasting sweetener.

It can be sold raw,<br> processed, or infused for profit.

Honey is also used in cosmetics, <br>medicine, and food industries.

<h4>💰 3. Income from Bee Products</h4>
Besides honey, bees produce:

Beeswax – used in candles, cosmetics, and polish.<br>

Propolis – used in natural medicines and supplements.<br>

Royal Jelly – sold as a health supplement.<br>

Bee venom – used in apitherapy and anti-aging products.<br>

<h4>🌿 4. Sustainable and Low-Cost Farming</h4>
Beekeeping doesn’t require large land or expensive inputs.<br>

Bees forage naturally—no need to feed them expensive food daily.<br>

It's possible to combine bees with other farming activities,<br> like growing fruits, vegetables, or herbs.

<h4>🌍 5. Environmental Benefits</h4>
Bees support biodiversity and healthy ecosystems.<br>

Keeping bees increases plant reproduction in both wild<br> and cultivated areas.

They help prevent soil erosion by enabling more plant <br>growth.

<h4>🧠 6. Education and Awareness</h4>
Beekeeping teaches patience, responsibility,<br> and respect for nature.

It raises awareness about climate change and the<br> importance of protecting pollinators.

<h4>🌱 7. Boosts Crop Quality</h4>
Crops pollinated by bees often have better shape,<br> size, and taste.

Increased pollination <br>can improve harvest quantity and quality,<br> leading to more profit.
